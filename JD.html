        <h1 id="k3">John Doe</h1>
<p> John Doe is based on the second account to join Roblox, originally created as a test account in 2005. 
    Despite its mundane origin, the account became the center of a popular Roblox urban legend, claiming that he and Jane Doe would return to destroy Roblox on March 18, 2017.

<p>In Forsaken, John Doe continues this infamous objective—but his mind has become corrupted after fusing with the remnants of Roblox's old, defunct code. 
    Now guided by that corruption, he seeks to eliminate anyone in his path, driven by a single goal: to destroy all of Roblox.</p>
    
<h2>Lore</h2>
<p>John Doe was once an ordinary Robloxian who lived a happy life with his wife, Jane Doe. 
    Though married, they never had children. Their lives changed forever when John Doe was tragically consumed by Roblox's old, defunct code. 
    Jane Doe, powerless to stop it, witnessed her husband endure the excruciating ordeal as the code tore through his body and rewired his mind, leaving her permanently traumatized. 
    The corruption mutilated his body, shattered his mind, and erased his surface memories of his wife, leaving only a violent John Doe programmed to kill.</p>

<p>How John Doe became forsakened by The Spectre remains unknown. 
    Despite his corruption, he is implied to still harbor subconscious love for Jane Doe. 
    This causes him to resist The Spectre's command to kill her, prompting the entity to black out her face so he can continue killing without hesitation.</p>

                    John Doe punches his corrupted arm into the ground and, when he pulls it out, 26 giant spikes — which have a lifespan of 14s each — emerge in front of him.
                    Any survivor that is directly hit by the spikes takes 12 damage, and John Doe is given Speed I for 7 seconds. The spikes cannot hit the same survivor more than 4 times.

                    <p>John Doe stomps on the ground three times, commanding a shadow to emerge underneath his footsteps as a trap for survivors to walk over. There can be a maximum of 3 traps at any given time, and each trap only has a maximum lifespan of 165 seconds.</p>
                    <p>If a survivor steps over the false shadow, it will disappear, and John Doe is given Speed I for 10 seconds, while the survivor gets inflicted with Corrupted I and Slowness II for 10 seconds. Both John Doe and the survivor will also have their auras revealed to each other.</p>
