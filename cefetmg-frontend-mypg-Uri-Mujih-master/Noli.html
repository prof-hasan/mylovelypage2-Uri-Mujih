<p> Noli in Forsaken is based on a Roblox myth of the same name, often regarded as one of the platform's earliest urban legends. The myth originated in February 2010, when a user named "YaleUniversity" made a post describing a mysterious account called Noli and the strange events surrounding it. The account was later deleted, presumably by Roblox. Since then, Noli has become one of the most well-known Roblox myths, with theories suggesting he is a hacker, a glitch, or a ghost.</p>

<p>In Forsaken, the true motives behind Noli's violent actions remain unclear. However, one of his audio files suggests that the Void Starâ€”an artifact he discovered and was pressured to touch by his former partner in crime, 007n7, who appears as a survivorâ€”ultimately consumed and corrupted him once he made contact with it, tragically turning him into a violent killer. Recent developer input also implies that Noli sadistically views the games as a performance, with the survivors merely serving as extras in his show.[1]</p>

                    <p>he minigame requires the survivor to click on 5 pop ups on their screen to free themselves. After a survivor escapes ENTANGLEMENT, they gain Speed I for 1.25s.</p>

Even if there isn't a Dusekkar, survivors may also see a spawn protection shield around them. Looking at where the fake shield is coming from will be Noli's hallucination head, which will then fly towards the survivor if they continue looking at it, causing temporary blindness.</li>
