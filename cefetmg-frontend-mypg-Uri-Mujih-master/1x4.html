<p>1x1x1x1  is a purchasable killer, available for 1,250 Player Points Player Points. Specializing in long-range combat, he fires wall-piercing projectiles that deal heavy damage and can revive fallen survivors as hostile entities. His melee slashes are also effective, especially when combined with His other abilities. However, he requires some skills to master—particularly in predicting survivor movements to attack effectively.</p>

<p>In the Roblox community, 1x1x1x1 was long rumored to be a hacker following the account's creation on October 25, 2007.[1] However, the account was originally created by Shedletsky, Roblox's former Creative Director, as part of Roblox's early lore. In that lore, 1x1x1x1, also known as The Adversary, is an entity from the fourth dimension who seeks to destroy Roblox for existing in only three dimensions but was ultimately imprisoned by 2x2 at the dawn of time.[2]</p>
