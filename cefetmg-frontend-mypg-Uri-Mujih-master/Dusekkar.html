    <p>Dusekkar in Forsaken is based on former Roblox Technical Director and Chief Architect Matt T. Dusek, who worked at Roblox from 2006 until 2019. He was the second employee hired at Roblox, following Shedletsky.</p>

    <p>In Forsaken lore, Dusekkar and Shedletsky, who is also a survivor in Forsaken, were ambushed by 1x1x1x1, who presumably managed to kill Shedletsky. Heartbroken and deeply depressed, Dusekkar eventually met his end when he was taken into the world of Forsaken while sleeping.</p>
