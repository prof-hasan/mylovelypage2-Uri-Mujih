    <p>Noob  is a Survivalist survivor, available for free upon joining the game for the first time. They have several food items at their disposal, which are used to help them escape threats.</p>

    <p>Noob is a popular depiction of a new player, based on one of the three default avatars from 2005 to 2007. They have become the face of the term Noob and represent new players in Forsaken. The name is derived from the term "Newbie." They are known for being a noob.</p>

                  <p> Noob drinks a can of Bloxy Cola for 2.5 seconds, granting them Speed I for 10 seconds and removing all existing Slowness effects. While drinking, Noob cannot sprint and has 10% less speed.</p></td>
                <td><p>Slateskin Potion-Keybind E</p>
                    <p>Noob drinks a bottle of Slateskin Potion for 1.5 seconds, giving them Slateskin II for 6 seconds, providing 80 overheal but slowing them by 45%. The ability can be recast after 2.5 seconds of usage to remove the effect manually. If Slateskin wears off naturally (waiting for the Slateskin effect to wear off), Noob gains Speed II for 2 seconds, but if it is ended manually, it only gives Speed I. While drinking, Noob has 40% less speed and cannot sprint. Unlike other abilities, the cooldown for this ability only triggers once Noob's Slateskin effect wears off.</p></td>

                    <p>Noob eats a Ghostburger, gaining Undetectable II for 10 seconds and Invisibility III for 8 seconds. This makes their aura unreadable and renders them 75% transparent. While eating, Noob has 40% less speed and cannot sprint.</p></td>
