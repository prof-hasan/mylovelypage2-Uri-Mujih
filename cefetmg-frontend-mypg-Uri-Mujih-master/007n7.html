    <p>007n7 in Forsaken is based on the creator of the infamous Roblox hacker group "Team c00lkidd." He created c00lkidd as an alternate account and developed the "c00lgui" back in 2014, which was used to disrupt some of the most popular Roblox games at the time, such as Work at a Pizza Place.</p>

    <p>In Forsaken lore, 007n7 is the adoptive father of C00lkidd. However, at some point while c00lkidd was under his care, c00lkidd had started hacking, which he used to wreak havoc, and eventually went missing (presumably forsakened).</p>

                   <p> When activated, 007n7 taps into his exploits to create a clone of himself that lives for 10s before dying. Upon creating a clone, 007n7 is given Invisibility IV and Undetectable I for 4 seconds. If 007n7 touches their clone after 2 seconds of it being created, the clone will immediately die and 007n7 will be given Weakness II for 4 seconds.</p>
                    <p>The clone, by default, will wander aimlessly, but this can be changed through using the Inject ability (see below). (007n7's clone's aura will be white.)</p></td>

                    <p>007n7 stays in place for 6 seconds before teleporting away to the furthest survivor spawn location from him.</p>
                    <p>Being hit and/or starting a generator repair cancels it immediately, and the player will need to wait for the 50s cooldown to end for the ability to be used again.</p></td>

                    <p>Upon activation, the clones created using 007n7's Clone ability will have their movement type switched.(This will not change the current clone's movement type if there is one.)</p>

                        <li>Cursor: The clone moves towards the player's cursor. On mobile, the clone will instead run in the direction the player is facing, so using shiftlock is not advised.</li>
