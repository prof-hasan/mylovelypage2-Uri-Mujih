<p> C00lkidd is based on the alternate account of the infamous Roblox hacker 007n7. In 2014, 007n7 and his friends exploited games like Work at a Pizza Place and Natural Disaster Survival before his accounts were terminated.</p>

<p> In forsaken C00lkidd is the 10-year-old adoptive son of 007n7, also a survivor in Forsaken. After receiving the c00lgui from his father—a life-changing mistake—he unleashed chaos throughout Roblox, especially in Work at a Pizza Place, then disappeared. Both were Forsakened by The Spectre, who now manipulates c00lkidd into believing he is playing Tag.</p>
   <h2>Lore</h2>
<p>C00lkidd was once a normal child. At birth, he was abandoned and left on 007n7's doorstep. 007n7 took him in and retired from exploiting to become a parent to C00lkidd. As C00lkidd grew older, he discovered his father's old exploits—the C00lgui—which he used to cause chaos, most notably at Builder Brothers' Pizza. This led to 007n7 being blacklisted from the establishment.</p>

<p>One day, C00lkidd went missing, as depicted in 007n7's Milestone IV render, likely Forsaken under unknown circumstances. After his damnation, The Spectre transformed C00lkidd's body, making it more grotesque, and exploited his young mind—manipulating him into believing his kills were all part of a game.</p>

                    <p>C00lkidd immediately launches a projectile that goes through walls and survivors. If a survivor is hit by the projectile, they take 15 damage, are inflicted with Slowness I for 4s, and their aura is revealed to C00lkidd for 10 seconds.</p>

                    <p>The lunge stops prematurely upon collision with a survivor or obstacle. Colliding with a survivor during the lunge causes them to take 30 damage, alongside applying Burning I for 10s. This deals a total of 45 damage.</p>
