    <p>Shedletsky in Forsaken is based on the well-known Roblox player of the same name (or formerly known as Telamon). His full real name is John James Shedletsky, III, a retired Roblox Creative Director, Administrator, and the company's fourth hired engineer.</p>
       <p> He developed key features such as character animations and the Roblox API, and created popular games including the classic and nostalgic Sword Fights on the Heights (SFOTH).</p>

    <p>Shedletsky is also the creator of the infamous 1x1x1x1 account, a notorious figure in Roblox lore and his fictional rival—who also appears as a killer in Forsaken.</p>

                    Shedletsky slashes forward, dealing 30 damage and stunning the killer for 3 seconds if it hits. Upon activation, Shedletsky is given Resistance II for 0.575 seconds, alongside being slowed down by 75% for 1.575 seconds.</td>
                <td>Fried Chicken-Keybind E-Cooldown 70s
                    Shedletsky pulls out a piece of fried chicken and takes a bite out of it, immediately restoring 5 HP and 35 HP across the span of 10 seconds. 
                    If Shedletsky is hit at any point, the regeneration is cancelled. This ability only has two charges before becoming unusable.</td>
