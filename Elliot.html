    <h1 id="t3">Elliot</h1>
    <p>Elliot in Forsaken is based on Elliot Builder, an iconic pizza delivery boy and the signature mascot of Builder Brothers Pizza, as well as the Roblox game where the pizzeria is set: Work at a Pizza Place.</p>

    <p>In Forsaken lore, little is known about Elliot or how he ended up here. However, it is known that he worked practically every job at Builder Brothers Pizza—not just as a delivery driver—and endured the chaos caused by C00lkidd in Work at a Pizza Place, which is also featured as a map in Forsaken.</p>
