<p class="maybeEgg">1x1x1x1  is a killer specializing in long-range combat, he fires wall-piercing projectiles that deal heavy damage and can revive fallen survivors as hostile entities. His melee slashes are also effective, especially when combined with His other abilities. However, he requires some skills to master—particularly in predicting survivor movements to attack effectively.</p>
<div class="randomContent" style="display: none;">
        <p>1Eggs is an april fools joke within the forsaken community comming from an misunderstanding of "ONE X" on the champion 1x1x1x1 OST,turning into "One EGGS", that concept later on ended up transformed into an actual skin;It uses two frying pan and quotes memes in its voicelines.</p>

<p class="maybeEgg">In the Roblox community, 1x1x1x1 was long rumored to be a hacker following the account's creation on October 25, 2007.[1] However, the account was originally created by Shedletsky, Roblox's former Creative Director, as part of Roblox's early lore. In that lore, 1x1x1x1, also known as The Adversary, is an entity from the fourth dimension who seeks to destroy Roblox for existing in only three dimensions but was ultimately imprisoned by 2x2 at the dawn of time.[2]</p>

                    <p>Although the zombies are loyal to 1x1x1x1, 1x1x1x1 can kill them to gain Speed I for 10s, with the maximum stack being Speed III. The ability starts off with 0 charges and a charge is given on kill. Max of 1 charge.</p>
