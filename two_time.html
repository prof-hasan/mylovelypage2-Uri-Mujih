    <h1 id="t9">Two Time</h1>
    <p>Two Time belonged to a cult that believed in respawning/resurrection, alongside Azure. The two were partners, being shown spending time together in several renders (Milestones 1 and 2, and Chrisaken) and a photo of them together before his murder (which can be seen in both the current Milestones I-IV and the legacy version of Milestone IV). At some point, Two Time's beliefs began to grow more and more demented until they eventually stabbed and killed Azure with a dagger, as a sacrifice in order for them to receive their second life, which is depicted in their third milestone.</p>

    <p> At first, they were regretful about doing this, however in their fourth milestone, Two Time's photo has Azure crossed out and the words "GLORY TO THE SPAWN" has been written on it showing their complete devotion to The Spawn. Azure's sacrifice is how he became a killer.</p>

                    <p>After a 0.3s windup, you'll stab your dagger forward and gain Resistance III for 0.7 seconds with a very slight lunge. </p>
                    <p>If it hits the killer in the front, it'll deal 25 damage, apply slowness II, helpless I to the killer both for 2s and heal two time for 10. </p>
                    <p>However, if it hits the killer's back (the dagger will have a unique startup animation for feedback, along with Two Time smirking if you're in the correct position to do this) it stuns for 4s, does 35 damage, and heals two time for 20.</td>
                <td><p>Crouch-Keybind E-Cooldown 35-50s</p>
                    <p>Crouch down, reducing your movement speed to 9 (15 when sprinting) and become undetectable and invisible.  </p>
                    <p>When exiting, you get slowness depending on distance from killer, cool down increases with time crouching. You can stab out of a crouch. Undetectable and Invisibility last 15s and so does crouch itself.</td>
                <td><p>Ritual-Keybind R-Cooldown N/A </p>
                    <p>Carve the respawn symbol into the ground with your dagger. This symbol emits a faint glow. This animation is when activating the power (Ritual).</p>
                    <p>This is where you'll respawn. When dying to the killer with your respawn ready, the timer won't increase, and you'll respawn, being highlighted to the killer for 2s after respawning. You gain full immunity to status effects and damage for 2s after respawning. You do not need to fill the oblation bar to enter the second life when you're in LMS(Last Man Standing)</p>
                </td>
                <td><p>Oblation-</p>
                    <p>Two Time now has a oblation bar in the side of the screen that only the user can see. This bar appears upon dealing damage. Filling this bar grants the player their second life, however to do so, you'll have to deal 70 damage to fill it. Stats change when respawning, making Two Time have 40 HP. Two Time is also granted Speed II for 6 seconds and Weakness V for 12 seconds when respawning.</p>
                    <p>Upon entering LMS(Last man Standing) if this second life has not been used, instead gain (Bar% x 30-40) additional MaxHealth and Health.</p>
