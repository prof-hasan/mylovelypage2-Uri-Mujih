<h1 id="k1">Slasher</h1>
<p> The Slasher was introduced to avoid copyright conflicts with the Friday the 13th franchise and Warner Bros. 
    Jason was considered too similar to Jason Voorhees, and since New Line Cinema, a subsidiary of Warner Bros, holds the rights to the character, they are strict about its use without legal consent. Despite the redesign, however, The Slasher is fundamentally the same. 
    He still retains the first name Jason and continues to draw inspiration from the same sources: Jason from the Roblox horror game Survive and Kill the Killers in Area 51 and Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th franchise. His gameplay also remains unchanged.</p>

<p> In Forsaken lore, The Slasher is a bacon-haired prisoner of war from The Last Guest, an animated series by ObliviousHD. After being captured and subjected to inhumane experimentation in Area 51, he escaped alongside Jeff The Killer and Slenderman. He later discovered the Necrobloxicon, a cursed book whose mysterious voice convinced him it was his mother, prompting him to wage revenge through violence.</p>
<p>The Slasher's full story is not entirely known, but key details suggest strong parallels to his original inspiration. He is a bacon-haired Robloxian named Jason who was a bacon soldier during the war depicted in The Last Guest. They were captured and held prisoner at Area 51—the same facility featured in the popular Roblox game Survive and Kill the Killers in Area 51. While imprisoned, he was subjected to cruel experiments until he discovered the Necrobloxicon, a cursed book parodying H. P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon. The original tome is said to drive readers insane with dark magic and resurrection spells, and the Necrobloxicon serves as its Roblox counterpart.</p>

                    <p>Slasher winds up a strong horizontal swing to the head of his target and has a small lunge, inflicting Helpless I for 14s, and dealing 20 damage — or 35 if <strong>ENRAGED</strong> — upon contact.

Each slash deals around 1/5th of the attack's total damage, adding up to 50 in total, or 70 if Slasher is <strong>ENRAGED</strong>.</p>
