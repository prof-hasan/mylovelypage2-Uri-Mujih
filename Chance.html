    <h1 id="t10">Chance</h1>
    <p>If the coin lands on heads (a favorable outcome), Chance can gain additional health and acquire charges that allow him to fire his flintlock, which is capable of stunning the killer if aimed correctly. Conversely, if the coin lands on tails (an unfavorable outcome), he may become weakened, experience a flintlock misfire, or suffer an explosion that causes significant self-damage.</p>

    <p>In Forsaken lore, Chance is an avid gambler who often visited a casino run by the Sonnellino mafia family, maintaining friendly relations with them. However, after winning a rigged game, Chance stole the prize money and fled, severely straining his relationship with the family and leaving him deeply in debt. Now, he is relentlessly pursued by Don Sonnelino—also known as Mafioso a C00lkidd skin—the head of the family who leads the manhunt. He and his family seek revenge on Chance until the stolen money is returned.</p>
