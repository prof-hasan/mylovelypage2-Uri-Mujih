    <p>Guest 1337 is based on the main protagonist of ObliviousHD's animated series The Last Guest. Hailed as a Robloxian war hero, he was declared the Last Guest and joined the Roblox Army to battle the militarized, bacon-haired terrorist regime known as the Bacon Empire, which was responsible for the near-extinction of his kind. In the Forsaken universe, he ultimately perished during the final events of the first movie in The Last Guest series, sacrificing himself with a grenade to kill the Bacon General.[1] This act of self-sacrifice led to his arrival in the Forsaken realm.</p>

    <p>Guest 1337 had a normal life until his parents were killed by the Bacon General. After their deaths, he was sent to an orphanage, where he met his childhood friends Daisy and Matt. Ten years later, after marrying Daisy and having a child, Guest 1337 tragically learned he was the last remaining Guest. Determined, he joined the Roblox Army alongside Matt to protect his family, avenge his parents, and fight against the Bacon Empire.During the war, when Matt was shot—critically injuring him and knocking him unconscious—the Roblox Army was vastly outnumbered in both manpower and firepower. The army captain ordered an immediate retreat, but Guest 1337, after attempting to wake the unconscious Matt, refused to follow the order.</p>
    <p>Bravely, he made a last stand, charging into enemy lines and taking down multiple Bacon soldiers using martial arts and a grenade. The Bacon General, desiring to kill him personally, allowed him to push forward. Guest 1337 reached the heart of the Bacon forces before being shot in the leg by the Bacon General.As the General stood over the injured Last Guest, pistol in hand, ready to deliver the final blow, he said, "What a pleasure to meet you, the Last Guest. Any last words before I blow your brains out?" Spotting a nearby oil tank, Guest 1337 shouted, "Yeah! Go to Hell!" He then pulled out a grenade and detonated it on the spot—killing himself, the General, and triggering a massive explosion amplified by the oil tank.</p>

                        <p>Guest 1337 braces for impact, applying Resistance V (aka Invincibility) for 1s and has their movement speed reduced by 80% for 2s. Upon successfully blocking an attack, Guest 1337 has their movement speed restored, their Resistance status removed, and is given Speed I for 3s. Successful blocks restore a charge for Guest 1337's Punch ability.</p>
                        <p>Projectiles CANNOT be blocked though resistance is still aplied.</p>

                        <p>Guest 1337 winds up his fist for 0.8s and punches forward, stunning any killer within range of his punch for 2s. If this ability is used within 1s of a successful block, then it becomes a Parry.</p>
                        <p>Parried punches have a windup time of 0.625s, and stun the killer for 3.5s.</p>

                        <p>Guest 1337 dashes forward in a shoulder-bash pose for 1.5s. If Guest 1337 collides with the killer during his charge, then the killer is knocked back and has their abilities locked for 1.25s. Guest 1337 also becomes invincible for 1.25s.</p>
                        <p>If Guest 1337 charges into a killer whom was already charged into 10 seconds prior, they will take 15 damage and the charge's effects will be nullified. Not landing a charge on an enemy inflicts Slowness II that lasts for 3 times Guest 1337's distance from the nearest killer divided by 13. Charge ends automatically if you crash into a wall.</p>
